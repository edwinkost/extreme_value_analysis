Actually, the folder 2050-2099 contains the values for the time period 2060-2099 (2080 as its mid year). 
Edwin H. Sutanudjaja kept and used the folder name 2050-2099 in order to preserve the folder structure as used in the previous/old version (version_2017_05_XX), as requested by IVM-VUA Amsteram (see Philip Ward's email below, sent on 14 Feb 2018). 

In the previous/old version (version_2017_05_XX), Edwin somehow used the period 2050-2099 (2075 as its mid year) for representing the year 2080. This was not correct and this was also not consistent to the previous flood analyzer results (see the SI of Winsemius et al., 2016 - Global drivers of future river flood risk - nclimate2893). 

In the new result (version_2018_05_29), Edwin corrected this issue. Yet, Philip asked Edwin to upload the results/files to the same folder and make sure that they have exactly the same format, names, folder structure, and variable names as the previous version (version_2017_05_XX).

Hi Tianyi

Yes, we can produce the .csv files for impacts by that date, with the following disclaimers:

Assuming the hazard layers are available on 28 Feb and have exactly the same format, names, folder structure, and variable names as the previous versions (i.e. our batch files can be seamlessly launched)
Assuming Cartesius is running ok (and not in maintenance) and that the jobs are picked up quickly. Basically this means we can complete the runs in ca 4-5 days after Cartesius picks the jobs up â€“ the length of the queue and business of the supercomputer is of course out of our control.

Best

Philip
